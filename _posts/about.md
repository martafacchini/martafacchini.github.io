I am a PhD student at the Centre for Research on Social Inequalities ([CRIS](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en.html)), Sciences Po, and at the French Institute for Demographic Studies ([INED](https://www.ined.fr/en/)). 

I am interested in investigating the differentials in educational attainment based on family background, gender and ethnicity; the effect of parents' employment uncertainty on children development; the impact of educational tracking on the formation of inequalities in the life-course; labor market returns to education; and policy evaluation.


Thank you for your attention.
