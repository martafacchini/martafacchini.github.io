Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [INVEST Research Flagship Center](https://invest.utu.fi/), University of Turku. 

Previously, I was a PhD student in Sociology at the Centre for Research on Social Inequalities ([CRIS](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en.html)), Sciences Po, and at the French Institute for Demographic Studies ([INED](https://www.ined.fr/en/)). I was also a Lecturer at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en), and I graduated in Sociology and Social Research (M.A.) from the [University of Trento](https://www.sociologia.unitn.it/en). 


I study social inequality: how it is reproduced and how we can help reduce it. In my dissertation, I have investigated how parents' employment uncertainty affects their children's development using the French birth cohort [Elfe](https://www.elfe-france.fr/en/). I am interested in analysing inequality of educational opportunity, labour market, and health outcomes. I am also keen on evaluating the impact of public policies on inequalities throughout the life-course.
